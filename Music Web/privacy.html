                    the User without undue delay when there is a breach of security of personal data that is likely to
                    involve a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Following the provisions of
                    Article 4 of the GDPR, a breach of security of personal data means any breach of security resulting
                    in the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored
                    or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to such data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal data will be treated as confidential by the Data Controller, who undertakes to inform and
                    to ensure by means of a legal or contractual obligation that such confidentiality is respected by
                    its employees, associates, and any person to whom it makes the information accessible.

                <p><strong>Rights arising from the processing of personal data</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The User has over Ieguil and may, therefore, exercise against the Data Controller the following
                    rights recognized in the RGPD and the Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
                    Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights:

                            <i>Right of access:</i> this is the User's right to obtain confirmation of whether or not
                            Ieguil is
                            processing their personal data and, if so, to obtain information about their specific
                            personal data and the processing that Ieguil has carried out or will carry out, as well as,
                            among others, the information available on the origin of such data and the recipients of the
                            communications made or planned of the same.

                            that proves to be inaccurate or, taking into account the purposes of the processing,
                            incomplete, amended.

                            that the legislation in force does not provide otherwise, to obtain the deletion of his/her
                            personal data when they are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were
                            collected or processed; the User has withdrawn his/her consent to the processing and the
                            processing has no other legal basis; the User objects to the processing and there is no
                            other legitimate reason to continue the processing; the personal data have been processed
                            unlawfully; the personal data must be deleted in compliance with a legal obligation; or the
                            personal data have been obtained as a result of a direct offer of information society
                            services to a minor under 14 years of age. In addition to deleting the data, the Controller,
                            taking into account the technology available and the cost of its implementation, must take
                            reasonable steps to inform the controllers that are processing the personal data of the data
                            subject's request for the deletion of any link to such personal data.

                            of his or her personal data. The User has the right to obtain the limitation of processing
                            when he/she contests the accuracy of his/her personal data; the processing is unlawful; the
                            Controller no longer needs the personal data, but the User needs it to make claims; and when
                            the User has objected to the processing.

                            structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transmit it to another
                            Controller. Whenever technically possible, the Data Controller shall transmit the data
                            directly to such other controller.
                        </p>

                                profiling:</i> It is the right of the User not to be subject to an individualized
                            decision based solely on automated processing of personal data, including profiling,
                            existing unless otherwise provided by law.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thus, the User may exercise their rights by written communication addressed to the Data Controller
                    with the reference "RGPD-https://ieguil.com/", specifying:

                            admitted, it will also be necessary the identification by the same means of the person
                            representing the User, as well as the document proving the representation. The photocopy of
                            the DNI may be substituted by any other means valid in law that proves the identity.

                <p>
                    The Web Site can include hyperlinks or links that allow access to web pages of third parties
                    different from Ieguil, and that therefore are not operated by Ieguil. The owners of such websites
                    will have their own data protection policies, being themselves, in each case, responsible for their
                    own files and their own privacy practices.

                <p><strong>Claims before the control authority</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In the event that the User considers that there is a problem or infringement of the regulations in
                    force in the way in which his/her personal data is being processed, he/she shall have the right to
                    effective judicial protection and to file a complaint before a supervisory authority, in particular,
                    in the State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged
                    infringement. In the case of Spain, the supervisory authority is the Spanish Data Protection Agency
                    (https://www.aepd.es/).

                <li><strong>ACCEPTANCE AND CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></li>
                <p>
                    It is necessary that the User has read and agrees with the conditions on the protection of personal
                    data contained in this Privacy Policy, as well as to accept the processing of their personal data so
                    that the Data Controller can proceed in the manner, during the periods and for the purposes
                    indicated. The use of the Web Site will imply the acceptance of the Privacy Policy of the same one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ieguil reserves the right to modify its Privacy Policy, according to its own criteria, or motivated
                    by a legislative, jurisprudential or doctrinal change of the Spanish Data Protection Agency. Changes
                    or updates to this Privacy Policy will not be explicitly notified to the User. The User is
                    recommended to consult this page periodically to be aware of the latest changes or updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy was updated to adapt to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and
                    of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing
                    of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR) and to Organic Law 3/2018 of 5

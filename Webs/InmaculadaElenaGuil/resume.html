                    <p>
                        I am a strongly motivated artist who believes that music brings joy, passion and solidarity to people worldwide. I have studied
                        music internationally, in programs in Spain, Morocco, Britain, Italy and Jerusalem. Through hard work and dedication, I have
                        been chosen to perform in concerts in UK, around Italy, Israel/Palestine, Spain, Sahara Dessert and Bucharest among other
                        countries. I am an enthusiastic and energetic person who can't wait to collaborate and work in the music industry delivering
                        the true values of music to people all around the world!
